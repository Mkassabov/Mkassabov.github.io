							Fact: On several surfaces a line can intersect itself.
							On a cylinder, any line drawn “east” or “west” direction will intersect itself infinitely given the nature of the cylinders circumference.

						<h2 style="line-height: 1.2em;"> On a Sphere </h2>
						<p>
							This is true on a sphere also because there is only one kind of line that you can draw on a sphere.
							Every line drawn will cut the sphere in half and come back to where it began.
							One way to think of this, I am sure you can imagine that if you keep running in a circle, you will come back to where you began.
							Both of these lines will intersect themselves infinitely on their surfaces.

						<p>
							Fact/reasoning : On a cone there are two different types of lines.
							The “north” line will go over the apex and down the other side (infinitely).
							However, the “east/northeast” lines will look like a ribbon, snaking around the apex.

						<h2 style="line-height: 1.2em;"> On a Cylinder </h2>
						<p>
							Reasoning: On a cylinder, if you draw a line, and a point not all that line, you can draw a line that is parallel to the original line going through the point.
							However, if you draw a line going through the point on this line that is parallel the the original line, it will not be parallel and it will hit the original line and intersect, proving this statement true.

						<p>
							Fact/reasoning: On a sphere, you may have two polar points (represented in blue).
							This does not just create one unique line that would pass through both.
							Instead this would create an infinite amount of lines that could pass through those two points.

						<p>
							On a cone, there may be two points directly “north/south” of each other.
							There may be a line that spirals around hitting both of these two points.
							There may also be a line that goes directly “north/south” and hits the other line.
							On this cone this can be seen by the direct line being green, and the line that goes around the cone in black.

						<h1 style="line-height: 1.2em;"> Myth: All straight angles are congruent. </h1>
						<h2 style="line-height: 1.2em;"> On a Cone </h2>
						<p>
							On a cone, the line running through the apex will always be a straight angle.
							If you have two different cones, with lines through the vertex, both lines will be straight angles however they will not be congruent.
							This can be seen to the right, as the blue line appears straight on the cone, but on the UV Map of the cone it isn't straight.

						<h2 style="line-height: 1.2em;"> On a Sphere </h2>
						<p>
							On a sphere, any line drawn will break the sphere into hemispheres or bisect it, since there is only one kind of line on a sphere.
							A line drawn on the sphere has a straight to either side.
							A second line drawn on the sphere will create the same results.
							Since all the lines on a sphere are the same so will the straight angles, this proves the statement true.

						<p>
							Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR as it is most commonly referred to as, is a technology that is expanding rapidly in utilization among governments and gradually working its way into the private sector. 
							Given the relative youth of this technology, the rate of implementation is really quite amazing, currently there are 12 SAR satellites in orbit, by 2022 there will be over 125. 
							Synthetic Aperture Radar is important because of its advantages over optical sensing (cheapest passive sensor, think big camera), and its active sensor siblings. 
							SAR can create both 2D and 3D images of objects on earth from space. 
							It does this by measuring the motion of its radar antenna, which sends and receives Ir/radio waves over a region of interest, for example a PetroChina oil field. 
							It does this to provide better images than its siblings, more reliably. 
							Some of the tech from the SAR comes from the SLAR, or side-looking aperture radar. 
							With the SAR radar system, you will get an image that looks like image 1 below. 
							However by performing calculations based on environmental factors such as the surface of earth and expected noise, experienced analysts can clean images up and make them into clearly readable images that they can use to make reports. 
							They usually do this by calculating blackbody based on angle and using that. 
							An example of this in Ithaca would would be Ursa Space Systems, which sells products like its China oil report after analyzing images purchased from foreign satellites to commodity exchanges and the Government. 
							They can very accurately track China’s oil supply, which it does not publicly disclose. 
							Non-Euclidean geometry is crucial for their research analysts since they use the geography and shape of earth to come up with accurate images. 
							On Earth, it can be hard to find a real use for non-Euclidean geometry since we do not look at things from an extrinsic perspective. 
							However, in space, non-Euclidean geometry is essential for information gathering.
